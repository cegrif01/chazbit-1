# Chazbit (static)
In collaboration with Charles Griffin, this is a respository to build out the static HTML and CSS for the upcoming Chazbit website. Files here are to later be populated with PHP and CMS functionality.

## Contents

## Notes for Dynamic Transition
* Images are currently stored at **/images**. If the coming CMS has a library manager for media, the locations for these images will need changed.
* The site header and footer are currently being dynamically added to the site with jQuery. This should be changed to PHP later.
* Change url paths to use proper directory (currently don't first direct to root due to github pages' weird url structure).
